This directory contains calc++, a simple Bison grammar file in C++.
It's almost completely based on the "A complete C++ example" described
in the GNU Bison manual.
The version avalible here has been adapted by myself for the course
"Linguaggi e compilatori" (Languages and Compilers) that I teach at the
University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.
This version essentially rules out the use of the driver class 
which will be re-introduced as a subsequent, more advanced example.

-----------------
Please, read the corresponding chapter in the documentation: "A Complete C++
Example".  It is also available on line (maybe with a different version of
Bison):
https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/A-Complete-C_002b_002b-Example.html

To use it, copy this directory into some work directory, and run `make` to
compile the executable, and try it.  It is a simple calculator which accepts
several variable definitions, one per line, and then a single expression to
evaluate.

The program calc++ expects the file to parse as argument; pass `-` to read
the standard input (and then hit <Ctrl-d>, control-d, to end your input).

$ ./calc++ -
one = 1
two = 2
three = 3
(one + two * three) * two * three
<Ctrl-d>
42

You may pass `-p` to activate the parser debug traces, and `-s` to activate
the scanner's.
